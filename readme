This is my attempt at writing libc in as little lines of C as possible.
Please forgive the very terse code.

Progress:

[] assert
[] ctype
[] errno
[] float
[] limits
[] locale
[] math
[] setjmp
[] signal
[] stdarg
[] stdef
[] stdio
[] stdlib
[] string
[] time

*Note: This will probably never be finished.
